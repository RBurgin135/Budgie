### A budgeting app for the web

I made this because I become increasingly frustrated with budgeting on spreadsheets. Naturally as a software engineer I decided to automate as much as I could. Creating it on the web allows me to setup a home server and access it from any device.

I have created it using React, hosted on firebase, using the firebase realtime database. The firebaserc and json are not within the repository.

It also contains a Dockerfile to be able to run within a container.
